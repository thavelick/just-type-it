Programming isn't about typing, it's about thinking and understanding the problem deeply. Before you write a single line of code, take the time to understand what you're trying to solve.

Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad. Quality matters more than quantity.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand. Don't prioritize the computer's convenience over the reader's.
